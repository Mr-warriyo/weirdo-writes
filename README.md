# Special Thanks to ❤️:
My only best friend, Ashwin, is an excellent storyteller who wanted to write a collaborated story with me and forced me to build this amazing Project, which made me learn a lot of new stuff; <br />
And the person who inspired the site's name: Weirdo, a person I met Online who loves to share her daily chit-chat with me and became the second inspiration for this project
